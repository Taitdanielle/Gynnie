## Design Choices: üé®
The design of this website had to be colourful and fresh like the many Gin's and cocktails created all over the world, The colours will attract the user to go through the website with interest. 

### Fonts:
I chose to use the ['Poppins'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font for the content on the website, it provides clear layout for the content on the website and easy to read.
### Colours:
The [colours](https://github.com/Taitdanielle/Gynnie/blob/master/wireframes/colours.png) I chose to use for this website are bright eye catching colours that will potentially increase the interaction levels on the website.
### Images:
The images I have chosen to use on the website were selected to invite people into the website by looking fresh,appelaing and bright.
### Wireframes: :wrench:
I designed the wireframes for this project using Balsamic, this allowed me to easily design a wireframe for multiple devices, and for all the pages and features I wanted to include on the project. Having these were useful to provide me with a layout to follow when writing the code for the website.
